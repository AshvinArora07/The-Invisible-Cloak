# The-Invisible-Cloak
An OpenCV project which uses an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation to make yourself invisible live in the webcam with the help of asingle-color cloth(Here I'm using a red cloth). 

Technologies Used: Python 3.9-> OpenCV library, NumPy library

BASIC IDEA behind the project:

1.Capture and store the background frame. 

2. Detecting the red colored cloth using color detection
algorithm. 

3. Segmenting out the red colored cloth by generating a mask. 

4. Generating the final augmented output to create the magical
   effect.
